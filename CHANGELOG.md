## Unreleased

## 1.4.2 - 2022-11-19

### Added

- Support Python 3.11.

## 1.4.1 - 2022-04-25

### Fixed

- Fixed custom decorators hiding functions docstrings.

## 1.4.0 - 2022-03-27

### Added

- `config.Config` object to store config.
  Config can be loaded from a file (once).
  When accessing a value, it is first searched in environment variables, then in stored values.
- Methods that add a message to a raised exception can be generated from `exceptions.generate_exception_handler`.
- All exceptions of the program can be caught in `__main__.py` with `exceptions.handle_all_exceptions`.
- Application directories are available with the object `directory.directories`.
- Mac OS support.

### Changed

- `config.load_config` was integrated in `config.Config` as method `load_file`.
  Its different actions were divided:
  - Loading the config file: `config.Config.load_file`;
  - Checking mandatory keys: `config.Config.check_mandatory_keys`; and
  - Setting debug mode: `config.Config.set_debug`.
- Checking the validity of parameters of `HTTPClient` is now done in the `load` method.

### Removed

- Dropped Python 3.5 and 3.6 support.

## 1.3.0 - 2021-04-10

### Changed

- Endpoint for HTTP client authenticated is stored in `dakara_base.http_client.HTTPClient.AUTHENTICATE_ENDPOINT` and can be edited.
  Default value was updated to `accounts/login/`.

### Removed

- Removed module `resources_manager`.
  Use the standard `importlib.resources` instead.

## 1.2.0 - 2019-11-10

### Added

- You can now specify custom log format and log level in `dakara_base.config.create_logger` with arguments `custom_log_format` and `custom_log_level`.
- Access to and create user-level stored Dakara config files with `dakara_base.config.get_config_file` and `dakara_base.config.create_config_file`.

### Changed

- `progress_bar`: the progress bar now displays percentage.

### Fixed

- `progress_bar`: When an exception was raised within a progress bar, it would prevent to stop the capture of stderr, leading to hide any further log entry.
